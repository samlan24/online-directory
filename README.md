## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/online-directory.git

cd online-directory
```
2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**

Before installing the dependencies, itâ€™s recommended to create a virtual environment:
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```
3. **Install Dependencies**

Install all the necessary dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Create and Configure a `.env` File**

You need to set environment variables for the project. In the root directory of your project, create a `.env` file with the following content:

```
# Flask Configuration
FLASK_APP=run.py
FLASK_ENV=development
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here

# Database Configuration
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI=mysql+mysqldb://username:password@localhost/your_database_name
```

Replace `username`, `password`, and `your_database_name` with your actual MySQL credentials. The secret key can be any random string.

5. **Initialize the Database**

You need to initialize and migrate the database schema for your application:

```
flask db init
flask db migrate
flask db upgrade
```
This will set up your MySQL database with the required tables.

6. **Running the Application**

After setting up the database and configurations, you can run the Flask application using:

```
flask run
```
Open `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your browser to access the Home Helper Directory.

7. **Testing the Application**

To test if the search functionality and filters are working correctly, try searching for agents by their name, location, or rating from the find-agent page. You can also create agent profiles and rate them from the agent details page.
